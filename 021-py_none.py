# When we talked about lists, we saw our special type "None"
# where some methods that worked on lists didn't really produce anything.
# They modified the lists in place, but the output of whatever they were
# doing was this thing called "None". What does this mean?
# If you remember, I mentioned "None" as a special data type that exists
# in Python and most languages have something like this to represent the
# absence of value and in some other languages you might have heard of "null".

# Example:
weapons = None
print(weapons)
